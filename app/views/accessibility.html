          <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
          <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
          <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
          <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>
