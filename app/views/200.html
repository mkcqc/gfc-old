      <p>We're sorry. We had to reset this form once you'd been on the same page for 2 hours. We do this to keep your information secure, for example if you're using a shared computer.</p>

      <p>It means you'll need to <a href="/">go back to the start</a> to enter your feedback.</p>

      <p>We'd still like you to tell us about your experience. People's feedback helps us understand the quality of care they get. It makes care better for everybody.</p>
