      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your feedback helps make care better</h2>

      <p>We use what people tell us to understand the quality of care they get from services like care homes, care agencies, hospitals and GPs. It helps make care better for everybody.</p>

      <p>We look at it alongside other information. For example, information from the service itself or what we found when we last visited them.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">We may want to contact you</h2>

      <p>You do not have to give us your name or contact details. But it's more likely we can take action if you do.</p>
