      <p>What people tell us about services helps us build a picture of the standard of care they give.</p>

      <p>We'll look at the information you've given us. How we use it will depend on what you've said. For example, if you've told us about a serious concern we'll take action, like contacting or visiting the service.</p>

      <p>If you've given us your email address, we'll email you again to tell you when we've passed your feedback to the right person. This will be in the next 2 working days.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can do</h2>

      <p>If your experience of care was bad, you can make a complaint to the service itself - if you haven't already.</p>
